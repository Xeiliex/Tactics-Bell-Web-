# Asset Unpack Plan
- [x] Import the new asset archives from the VS Code cache into an Assets/ folder and inspect their contents.
- [x] Extract each archive into a descriptive subdirectory under Assets/ so each pack is easy to find.
- [x] Confirm the organized assets have no duplicates, remove any temporary files, and document completion for the next agent.
